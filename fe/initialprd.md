PRD: Project "Nexus-Affiliate" (v1.0)Objective: Build an autonomous, AI-driven content ecosystem that identifies trends, generates SEO-optimized reviews, and publishes to a high-performance frontend to capture affiliate revenue.1. Executive SummaryGoal: To eliminate the manual overhead of content creation while maximizing Affiliate Click-Through Rate (CTR).Target Niche: Tech, AI Tools, and Lifestyle Gadgets.Core Logic: Trend Detection $\rightarrow$ Deep Research (Scraping) $\rightarrow$ AI Synthesis $\rightarrow$ Asset Creation $\rightarrow$ Multi-Channel Publishing.2. Technical Stack (The "Lead Dev" Choice)LayerTechnologyRationaleFrontendNext.js 15+ (App Router)For ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) and sub-second page loads.Orchestratorn8n (Self-hosted/Cloud)Best-in-class for Agentic AI workflows and long-running loops.Data ScrapingFirecrawl / Crawl4AIConverts raw HTML into clean Markdown for LLM consumption.LLM IntelligenceClaude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4oClaude for superior technical writing; GPT-4o for structured JSON.CMS / DatabaseSupabase (PostgreSQL)Scales easily; real-time updates for social media queues.Image EngineFlux.1 (via Replicate) / DALL-E 3High-fidelity visuals with accurate text rendering.Social / DistroAyrshare APIUnified API for X, LinkedIn, and Instagram.3. System Architecture & Workflow3.1. Phase I: Trend Intelligence (The Scout)Objective: Find what people are searching for now before the competition.Mechanics:n8n triggers every 6 hours to poll Google Trends and Product Hunt.AI filters results based on "Affiliate Viability" (Is there a product to sell?).Store "Candidate Topics" in Supabase.3.2. Phase II: Research & Synthesis (The Writer)Objective: Generate 100% unique, value-add content (not just AI fluff).Mechanics:Scraper fetches top 3 ranking articles for the chosen keyword.Agentic Prompting: AI acts as a "Senior Tech Reviewer."Output Structure: Markdown including H1-H4, Meta Description, FAQ, and "Comparison Tables."3.3. Phase III: Asset Generation (The Designer)Objective: Create high-quality feature images and "Product Cards."Mechanics:AI generates a "Main Hero" image based on the article title.Automated generation of social media snippets (1:1 and 9:16 aspect ratios).4. Feature Requirements4.1. The "Money" Components (Next.js)Dynamic Affiliate Slots: A React component that injects specific affiliate links based on the article category.Comparison Engine: A custom table component that renders from a JSON object (e.g., Price, Rating, "Buy Now" link).Ad-Placeholder Logic: Custom hooks to detect ad-blockers and prompt users to whitelist or show alternative internal affiliate banners.4.2. Automation & ReportingGoogle Sheets Sync: Every post must log: Date, Topic, Primary Affiliate Link, Social Post Status.Auto-Social: Posts are queued with a 1-hour delay after site publishing to ensure the URL is indexed/crawled.5. Success Metrics (KPIs)SEO Speed: Maintain a Lighthouse Score of 95+ (Crucial for ranking in 2026).Autonomy Rate: % of posts published without manual intervention.CTR: Percentage of users clicking the "Affiliate Buy" buttons.6. Implementation RoadmapMilestone 1: The "Skeleton" (Week 1)Setup Next.js Repo + Supabase.Design the ProductCard and ReviewLayout components.Milestone 2: The "Brain" (Week 2)Build the n8n workflow for Scraping $\rightarrow$ LLM Writing.Connect to OpenAI/Anthropic and Firecrawl.Milestone 3: The "Blast" (Week 3)Integrate Ayrshare for Social Media distribution.Setup Google Sheets logging for tracking.
